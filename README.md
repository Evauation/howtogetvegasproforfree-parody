## SERIOUS NOTE
MAGIX actually puts in a lot of work to improve Vegas Pro from the Sony era and people pirating Vegas Pro has actually hurt MAGIX in ways that you don't know it, they had to restructure due to filing for [Insolvency](https://www.reddit.com/r/VegasPro/comments/1bf9ibz/magix_files_for_insolvency/)

Do you ever wonder why people pirate Vegas Pro 13 and 14 most of the time? They describe it as the last best Vegas Pro version to use as it's "the most stable and reliable version to use"

Spoiler alert: It's not, Pirated Versions have more quirky behaviour than the actual legal bought versions and you're missing out! If you pirated Vegas Pro bcuz you didn't wanna pay for it? Why? You think it's like Adobe? Expensive? Bro, It's more fucking cheap than ever before, and if you optimize Vegas Pro properly, it's honestly really good to use.

I'm not endorsing for MAGIX or Vegas Pro or anything like that. It's just painful to learn that MAGIX has spent millions of dollars to improve Vegas Pro and bring it up to speed with the modern era of Video Editors and I've seen comments like

"oh i know all about piracy. luv my piracy. ~~because fuck paying $200 for sony vegas~~"
"real asf"

Is it that hard to pay for Vegas Pro (specifically how cheap it's gotten over the years), which is honestly one of the last software to offer proprietary licenses compared to everything else (except Davinci Resolve) that uses subscription models to let you use their software for a monthly price (looking at you adobe)

If you really have to pirate Vegas Pro, then maybe consider paying for it in the future. If you really don't wanna for Vegas Pro ever. Just go use **Davinci Resolve**



This was more of a rant than anything else after seeing SO MANY FAKE DOWNLOADS ON GITHUB.
